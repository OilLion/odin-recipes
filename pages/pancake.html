<h4>The perfect snack, fast and simple</h4>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>For 4-5 large pancakes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>200g flour</li>
    <li>200ml milk</li>
    <li>50g sugar</li>
    <li>sweet toppings</li>
    <li>margarine</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix eggs, flour, sugar and milk in a large bowl. Stir until no more clumps.
        Add additional milk, until desired consistency is achieved - experiment</li>
    <li>Heat up a pan and coat it in margarine</li>
    <li>Pour the pancake mix into the pan, so that it evenly covers the base</li>
    <li>Fry until pancake has become golden brown from one side, then flip and
        repeat for the other side</li>
    <li>Add toppings of your choice</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>My personal topic recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>marmalade</li>
    <li>apple sauce and cinnamon</li>
    <li>Nutella</li>
</ul>
<p>Savoury pancakes are also possible and delicious. Replace the sugar with salt
    and other spices to your liking. Cheese and bacon make excellent toppings for such
    a pancake</p>
